# Home Assistant Integration - ABB Free@Home via Local Api

This is a custom component to integrate with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) for the Busch Jaeger/ABB Free@Home system over the **local api server**.

The primary goal of this repository is to provide initial testing for the integration into Home Assistant. The ultimate goal of this integration is to be merged into the Home Assistant code as a built-in integration.

Because of this, the integration will adhere to the strict [styling and code guidelines](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/development_guidelines/) provided by Home Assistant.

## Device Support

This is a new repo written from the ground up in tandem with the PyPi Package [local-abbfreeathome](https://pypi.org/project/local-abbfreeathome/#description) in order to communicate with the ABB Free@Home System over the **local** api. **The initial list of supported devices is 1 (Switch/Actuator).**

The initial goal is to thoroughly test the integration (and by proxy the PyPi package) to ensure there are no bugs within the code. It's also to ensure it's feature and code complete (e.g. ZeroConf, UnitTests).

Once this is feature and code complete it should provide a solid base as to which new devices can be integrated into. I (kingsleyadam) don't have access to the number of different ABB devices and would rely on others to either provide configurations, or contribute code directly in order to add additional device support. It'll be much easier long-term if the core code is stable.

> **If you need support for additional devices I'd strongly reccomend you check out the repo [here](https://github.com/jheling/freeathome). That repo has been around for a long time and provides support for a number of devices.**

## Installation

### HACS

This repo has been setup to integrate with HACS. To do that you'll need to add it as a [custom repository](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/) within your Home Assistant installation.

Once added you'll be able to find it by searching for "Busch Jaeger/ABB Free@Home (Local API)".

### Manually

1. Clone the code locally and copy all the files in `custom_components/abbfreeathome_ci` to your Home Assistant directory `./config/custom_components/abbfreeathome_ci`
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. You should be able to add a new integration "Busch Jaeger/ABB Free@Home (Local API)".
4. Follow the UI configuration to add the integration to your instance.

## Configuration

### Local API, Credentials

Before you can setup this integration you must turn on the local API on your ABB Free@Home SysAP. More information about the local api can be found on the ABB site [here](https://developer.eu.mybuildings.abb.com/fah_local).

Navigate to: `SysAP Configuration` > `Settings` > `free@home - Settings` > `Local API` > `Activate Local API`

Copy the username listed within that window (usually `installer`) to be used when invoking the api. The password will be your personally set password to login to the app and web interface.

### Add Integration

When adding the integration you'll be prompted for the `Hostname`, `Username`, and `Password`. The hostname must be the fully resolvable hostname with protocol (e.g. http).

#### Example

- **Hostname**: `http://192.168.1.100`
- **Username**: `installer`
- **Password**: `<password>`

> Note: Support for SSL is not provided yet. For a valid SSL connection a cert pulled from the SysAP must be provided, research to be done to know if Home Assistant supports such a scenario.
